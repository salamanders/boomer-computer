1. (PC) Browser window moved 3/4 of the way off-screen.  User wasn't aware that it could be dragged back or double-clicked in the title bar to restore full-screen.  Any way to make all windows full-screen but not cover the taskbar?
2. Lots of junk newsletters in Gmail.  Not spam, but still an overwhelming number.
3. Keeping passwords shared with family members.
4. Being able to remotely view mobile screens
